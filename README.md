Description
This repository contains the solutions to three tasks assigned by iNeubytes. Two of the tasks are micro tasks, while one is a major task. Each task's details and solutions are provided in separate directories.


Task 1 - Micro Task
 Task 1 involved implementing a machine learning project using supervised learning techniques on the Iris Flower Dataset. I performed data preprocessing, explored data visualizations, and used algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVC, and Decision Tree Classifier to classify iris flowers into different species. The accuracy of each model was compared to identify the best-performing algorithm.


Task 2 - Micro Task
Description: In Task 2, I trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on the CIFAR-10 dataset using the VGG19 architecture with transfer learning. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across ten classes. I performed data preprocessing, including normalization and data augmentation. The VGG19 model pre-trained on a different dataset was utilized as the base model, and some initial layers were frozen to retain learned knowledge. I fine-tuned the later layers on the CIFAR-10 dataset and achieved an accuracy of 51.25%. To analyze model performance, I plotted confusion matrices for both the CNN model and the Transfer Learning model, providing insights into classification results and potential misclassifications. The repository includes code, data, and evaluation results to reproduce and visualize the experiment. Future work may involve exploring alternative transfer learning strategies and further improving classification performance.



Task 3 - Major Task
Description: In Task 3, I undertook a major project focused on sentiment analysis using the IMDb dataset. This dataset contains movie reviews labeled as positive or negative based on their sentiment. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, including data cleaning, tokenization, and label encoding to prepare the data for training. To enhance the classification performance, I employed Porter Stemmer to reduce word variations. A Naive Bayes classifier was then trained on the preprocessed data to predict the sentiment of movie reviews accurately. Additionally, I conducted a frequency analysis to identify the most repeated positive and negative words, and visualized them using WordClouds. The TF-IDF technique was applied to extract features from the text data. Furthermore, I performed sentiment analysis on five new movie reviews using the trained model to assess its performance on unseen data. To evaluate the classifier's performance, I plotted the precision-recall curve and ROC curve, providing insights into its precision and recall trade-offs and its ability to distinguish between positive and negative reviews.
